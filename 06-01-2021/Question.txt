Question 1.
Check whether the given linked list is either NULL-terminated or ends in a cycle
(cyclic).
OR
We are given a pointer to the first element of a linked list L. There are two
possibilities for L, it either ends (snake) or its last element points back to one of the earlier
elements in the list (snail). Give an algorithm that tests whether a given list L is a snake or
a snail.

Question 2.
Can we solve Problem-1 using the sorting technique?

Question 3.
Can we solve the Problem-1 in O(n)?

Question 4.
Check whether the given linked list is NULL-terminated or not. If there is a
cycle find the start node of the loop.

Question 5.
Check whether the given linked list is NULL-terminated. If there is a cycle, find
the length of the loop.
